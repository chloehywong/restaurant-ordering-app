# Restaurant Ordering App 
Building a seamless restaurant ordering app by practicing the basic Javascript concepts, for example: understanding const / let, Functions, Arrays, Conditional Statements, import/export data etc.  


## Requirements 
* This project is built from scratch with vanilla Javascript, and the UX experience can be improved by adding extra features in the future. 


## Netlify Deployment
This project uses [Continuous Deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment). In order to deploy the site using Netlify follow these steps:

* Create a new site by clicking the "Add new site" button.
* Push the repo to GitHub by linking Netlify to GitHub.
* Select the "Authorize Application" button to allow Netlify to access your repository code.
* Choose the repo that you would like to deploy from the list.
* Configure Your Settings and then click the "Deploy site" button to continue.
* All done! You can review the newly published site via the URL.


Note: when you create a Merge Request, Netlify will create a preview URL so you can check the changes on the browser.
